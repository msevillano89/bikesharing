# NYC Bike Sharing Analysis
## Overview
This project aims to analyze data from NYC CitiBike's bike-sharing business to understand the viability of establishing the same business in Des Moines. To solidify the initial business proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

The analysis will be displayed using Tableau's Story feature. It will contain a variety of visualizations, including:

- Length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results
### Published Tableau Analysis

### August at a glance
![Image Summary](https://github.com/msevillano89/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Summary.png)

- There were over 2.3 million rides for August 2019.
- Over 3/4 of the millions of riders are subscribed to the program. 

### Top Starting and Ending Locations

As noted in the visualizations above, the highest concentration of starting and ending locations are in tourist areas, for example, Manhattan.

### Trip Duration
![Tripduration](https://github.com/msevillano89/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Trip%20Duration.png)

We can see that most users utilize the bike for less than an hour. Most specifically, most rides usually last under a half-hour, then significantly drop in number after an hour.

### Weekly Usage

- The heatmap shown above helps us understand daily usage, where we can observe that the peak of use is during the work week during commuting hours of 8 AM and 6 PM. 
- Moreover, in the bar chart, we can determine that the optimal hours to repair the bike are between 12 AM and 5 AM.

### Weekly Trips by Gender

- The above analysis shows that most weekday rides are early, starting at 7 AM and during the evening at 5 PM. 
- We notice a similar pattern for weekend rides, with the highest usage at 10 AM. All rides are taken mainly by male users.

## Summary
In conclusion, the data shows high bike sharing activity in New York City during August 2019. This city is characterized by its prevalent metropolitan areas, high dense populations, and high traffic volume,  which have helped make alternative commuting options, like the bike sharing program, extremely popular. 

Additional analysis that would benefit the project include:
- Qualitative analysis to understand why the program is more popular for male and female subscribers.
- Bike usage through the seasons to understand how weather changes can impact the number of rides.
- Analysis of bike rides compared to the birth date of users to understand is the program is more popular for a specific population.
